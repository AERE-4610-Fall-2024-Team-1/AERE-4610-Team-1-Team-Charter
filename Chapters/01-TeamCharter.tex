    \item At a minimum, the team shall meet twice weekly for stand-ups—i.e., 15-minute status meetings.
    \item Meeting notes, minutes, and agendas shall be captured and shared via \textbf{OneNote} for each meeting.
\end{itemize}

\section {Engineering Process}

\begin{itemize}

    \item The team shall practice \textit{scrum}, an agile project management framework.
    \item The team shall follow the principles of agile project management.
    \item Major decisions shall be tracked in a decision log.
    \item All binary/non-text files (\textit{e.g.}, \textbf{SolidWorks} part/assembly files, CFD analysis files, pictures, \textbf{Ansys} files, \textit{etc.}) shall be stored and versioned in \textbf{Teams}/\textbf{SharePoint}.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Files that are subject to change shall have a version number appended to the file name that follows traditional \textit{semantic versioning}.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Semantic versioning: v\$\{major version\}.\$\{minor version\}.\$\{patch number\}
            \item \verb|nose_cone_v1.0.0.sldprt| — initial part
            \item \verb|nose_cone_v1.0.1.sldprt| — patch
            \item \verb|nose_cone_v1.1.0.sldprt| — minor change
            \item \verb|nose_cone_v2.0.0.sldprt| — major change
        \end{itemize}
        \item Major or minor versions shall be documented in a versioning spreadsheet.
    \end{itemize}
    \item All text-based files (\textit{e.g.}, scripts, \LaTeX{} documents, configuration files, \textit{etc.}) shall be stored and versioned in \textbf{GitHub}.
    \item All formal reports and presentations shall be drafted in \LaTeX.
\end{itemize}
